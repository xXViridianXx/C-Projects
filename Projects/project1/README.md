# Project 1 - Collatz

## Summary:
This program uses the collatz sequence formula in order to plot features such as Collatz sequence lengths, or number of new lines, the max Collatz value in a sequence, and a frequencey spectrum of the colaltz lengths.

## Run:
To the run the program, one can type "./plot.sh" if one has the make file or run it manually by using "clang -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wpedantic -o plot plot.sh. You might have to do "chmod +x plot.sh to make it executable.

## Expected Output:
The code should output 3 graphs labled collatz.pdf, max_sequence, and hist_lengths.

## Error Handling/Errors:
None, just follow the instructions silly goose!
